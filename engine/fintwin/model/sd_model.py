"""Stock-and-flow model of a company's financial machinery, stepped quarterly.

Stocks:  cash, receivables, inventory, payables, net PP&E, term debt, revolver, equity, other net assets.
Flows:   revenue, cash operating costs, D&A, interest, tax, SBC, working-capital changes, capex,
         dividends, buybacks, debt maturities, refinancing, revolver draws/repayments, equity issuance.
Loops:   R1 leverage -> coverage -> rating spread -> interest -> cash -> revolver -> leverage
         R2 distress -> lost market access -> maturities paid from cash
         B1 cash below floor -> capex, dividend and buyback cuts
         B2 margin squeeze -> delayed fixed-cost cuts

The core is deterministic given pre-drawn shocks `eps` [N, T, 5]
(revenue, margin, rate, discretionary financing, regime uniform),
so a second implementation (TypeScript, in the browser) can be checked against it number for number.
Everything is vectorized across the N Monte Carlo paths.
